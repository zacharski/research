# Thoughts on Machine Learning

### Things Claire and I talked about

### Format of Individual Study
This can be anything you want including:
1. Complete research focus - ex: I want to build a machine translation system for Mescalero Apache.
2. half-half: 1/2 semester take Udacity course learning some new technology - 2nd half doing research using that technology. for example, learn about deep learning then research deep learning for food reviews, or deep learning to build a chatbot. 
3. all learning - here the individual study is structured like a course you do on your own. You want to learn about X.

### Deep Learning and Tensorflow
You can get started with this just on your laptop using a Docker container.  A GPU on Google Cloud runs about $1/hr. 
See [the document I constructed on lab requirements for a Data Science Masters Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1HY1Ext6MTbsaZGO81F5D3Pd2taviLUcz4TwvUADiE/edit?usp=sharing)

[The Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) is a good one on Deep Learning.

### Hadoop
We talked briefly about what could be done with the cluster. Learning or Using Hadoop came to mind. Udacity has [an intro course on Hadoop](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-hadoop-and-mapreduce--ud617) -- I don't know the quality.


### Recent student papers at other universities

* Stanford's Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing Course [2015](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2015.html) and [2016](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html)


### notes from 21 Sept 2017

Possible research areas include:

* sentiment analysis
* authorship
* genre classification.  
* semantic similarity -- Large Scale Multi-label Text Classification
* poetry 

Also talked about bootstrapping systems.

### Poetry 
[Google's AI has written some amazingly mournful poetry](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-artificial-intelligence-poetry)
